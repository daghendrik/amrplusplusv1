Import Workflow
Before we can run some data, we need to import the AmrPlusPlus workflow.

Follow the instructions below.

Workflow Installation
Step 1
Navigate to the Workflow tab at the top of the Galaxy homepage.


Step 2
Click on the Upload or import workflow tab at the top right of the page.


Step 3
Click on the Visit myExperiment link at the bottom of the page.


Step 4
Type in amrplusplus into the search box.


Step 5
You will see two workflows (amrplusplus single-end workflow and amrplusplus paired-end workflow). Click on the amrplusplus paired-end workflow link. You can download the single-end workflow, but we'll be using the paired workflow when we get to the Run Workflow section.


Then, click on the Import button in the middle of the page.


Step 6
Now, let's upload some data.
