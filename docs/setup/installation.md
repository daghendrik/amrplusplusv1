# Installation

The following installation will take approximately 30 minutes.

## Software Requirements

To install Docker, you will need access to one of the following operating systems:

- Mac OS X (10.8 or above)
- Linux 64-bit

---

## Docker

??? example "Install via Docker"

    **Why Install via Docker?**
    
    - Docker packages an entire piece of software into its own filesystem.
    - Docker rids users of dependency nightmares caused by complex software.
    
    ###Step 1
    ####Download Docker
    Mac Users: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/installation/mac/#installation).
    Linux Users: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/installation/linux/).
    
    !!! Note
        You must have sudo privileges to install Docker via Linux.

    ---
    
    ###Step 2
    ####Start Docker with a Mac

    Open your Launchpad, and click on the DockerQuickStart icon. This will open a terminal and start Docker using a default virtual machine. Be sure to take note of the IP address (highlighted in red) Docker was started on.

    **The IP address will be different than the one highlighted below.**

    To launch your Galaxy instance, type this exact command into the terminal (omitting the '$' sign):

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8021:21 chrisd/amrplusplus
    ```
    
    ####Start Docker with Linux
    
    Open a terminal, and type these exact commands (omitting the '$' sign):

    ```
    $ sudo service docker start
    $ sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 8021:21 chrisd/amrplusplus
    ```
    
    !!! Note
        When running these commands for the first time, Docker will go out and look for the chrisd/amrplusplus repository and download the latest AmrPlusPlus Docker image. When the install completes, you should see a message similar to the one below.

        ```
        $ Digest: sha256:7e992b68ddb9a2e37a9f2b862de015445912d20cc98d13970603939330b0433e
        $ Status: Downloaded newer image for chrisd/amrplusplus:latest
        $ 10ab4d35cf798a2e46a0ec4e2eaf15377c3558772b3f5d0e1107025a9b922f76
        ```
        
        If you see this message, that means the latest version of the pipeline was downloaded successfully and is currently running on your machine.

    ###Step 3
    ####Connecting to the Server on a Mac
    
    Open a web browser, and navigate to:

    ```
    http://default-ip:8080
    ```
 
    !!! Warning
        Replace deafult-ip with the IP address Docker was started on. For example, if the IP address was 192.000.00.000, then you would enter http://192.000.00.000:8080 into your web browser. If you forgot the IP address, you can find it by scrolling to the top of your terminal.

    ---

    ####Connecting to the Server on Linux
    
    Open a web browser, and navigate to:

    ```
    localhost:8080
    ```
    
    Once connected, you should see a page similar to the following:

    ###Step 4
    ####Log in to Server
    
    Next, we need to login. From the navigation bar at the top of the Galaxy homepage, click on the **User** tab and goto **Login**.

    ![](../images/user_login.png)
    
    In the Username field, enter **admin@galaxy.org** and in the Password field, enter **admin** and click on the Login button.

    ###Step 5
    ####Import Workflow
    
    Next, we need to [Import the Workflow](import.md).

## Galaxy

??? example "Install via Galaxy"

    ###Before You Begin

    If you installed Galaxy via Docker, you do not need to read this section. Galaxy comes installed when you run Docker. See the [Import Workflow](import.md) for next steps.

    This section is only for those who have a production Galaxy server and wish to download the AmrPlusPlus pipeline via the Galaxy Main Toolshed.
